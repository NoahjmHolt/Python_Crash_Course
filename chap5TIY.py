Chapter 5: if statemends

What its about:
    looping thorugh stuff with different things

Im gonna be honest I have been writing ifs and fors and whiles the whole week
with boot.dev and other solutions from this book.
Not sure why this is so far back in the book but I know how this works
so am scimming and moving on.

# 5-1
# examining conditional statements and what the result in

# 5-2
# same as 5-1

# 5-3
# checking the color of something and if elif else to do different things.
# 5-4
# correction, 5-4 is the elif, 5-3 was several seperate if statements

# 5-5
# correction again 5-4 was if elses, 5-5 is elif

# 5-6
# doing the same thing but with numbers now

# 5-7
# similar to 5-2
