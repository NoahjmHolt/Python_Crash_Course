This will be important, a Notes page

All files will have a start section like this that is a what we are doing,
What I remember or may be thinking from the prompt

Will included the prompts once things begin getting complicated

Lastly, maybe steps taken to complete, mindset throughout the process
and maybe errors ran into and solutions found

One thing I want to re-find that I couldnt after 5 minutes of google is
sections for python, like commenting so that you can minimize and connect
sections together.
It works with these triple quote marks but I think there is a way to connect it
for over comments and code and maybe over several functions
Cant think of the proper name of it I guess so am struggling to find it.

The book: Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes and No Starch Press

No Starch Press is one of my favorite companies for coding books,
Sadly, I am pretty sure it is due to the texture of the book covers and the cartoons on the front

that aside, the have MANY python books from the basics like this, to scripting and data,
and the one I am most excited for, impractical projects.
I am excited for that one to see if it has out of the box things that require some 
fun projects to think through and change some views.

No skipping ahead. the basics are most important

Chapter 3: Intro to Lists

a chapter about making and manipulating lists
from what I remember, python treats all lists as dictionaries so lets see if that is right.

# Chap 2

Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types

what is a variable, what they hold, what can you do with them,
and intro to data types for beginners.

Im going to be honest, I read this chapter, it is about basic variables so I am skipping it,
exercises include:
    printing strings, doing different things with them.
    adding ints or other math functions
    same with floats and showing that the way they are stored as bits can cause weird things.
    Otherwise nothing fancy

# Chap 1
# forgot pycharm is weird and if there is no space in front of the
# start of the words, it throws a spelling error (**cough cough** dumb **cough cough**)

Chapter 1: Python install and Hello world

installing is easy, you can go to python.org or just search on Mac (which I am on) for your python version
or install the latest version with brew python

for hello world, print is auto included so no extra libraries and can call outside a function and run it in the terminal.
