This will be important, a Notes page

All files will have a start section like this that is a what we are doing,
What I remember or may be thinking from the prompt

Will included the prompts once things begin getting complicated

Lastly, maybe steps taken to complete, mindset throughout the process
and maybe errors ran into and solutions found

One thing I want to re-find that I couldnt after 5 minutes of google is
sections for python, like commenting so that you can minimize and connect
sections together.
It works with these triple quote marks but I think there is a way to connect it
for over comments and code and maybe over several functions
Cant think of the proper name of it I guess so am struggling to find it.

The book: Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes and No Starch Press

No Starch Press is one of my favorite companies for coding books,
Sadly, I am pretty sure it is due to the texture of the book covers and the cartoons on the front

that aside, the have MANY python books from the basics like this, to scripting and data,
and the one I am most excited for, impractical projects.
I am excited for that one to see if it has out of the box things that require some 
fun projects to think through and change some views.

No skipping ahead. the basics are most important


I need to apologize, the line directly above this one says "No Skipping ahead"
What have I done to chapters 2-6 so far?
Skimmed and skipped.

I will go back and do the end of chapter practices for each so that 
I am less of a terrible person and can stick to my word.

Sorry again... (to self)

# Chap 6

Chapter 6: Dictionaries

This bit confused me a little in school so will read this chapter a little slower.

# Chap 5

Chapter 5: If Statements

These work the same in basically every language so not sure if I will try or skim this chapter also

it reminds that = is used to assign and == is used to check and returns a boolean

goes over other comparitive operators but otherwise just about if statements, elif and else.

# Chap 4

Chapter 4: Working with lists

This chap say it will teach how to loop through lists 

Shows a for loop to start and in python it is simple, For x in y:

it reminds me that in python, the indentations it was matters for loops,
instead of brackets like other languages, python has indented segments 
that will end it when back on normal tab

Goes into Tuples which I never learned or glazed over first time learning to code.

    instead of [] it has ()
    
It recommends looking at something titled PEP 8 for styling recommendations for all python code

# Chap 3
'''

Chapter 3: Intro to Lists

a chapter about making and manipulating lists
from what I remember, python treats all lists as dictionaries so lets see if that is right.

starts by stating that it is 0 indexed (not sure if any language isnt but there is probably 1 (maybe R?)
There is .append, .insert, del, pop and other manipulations listed
There is sort which does alphabetical or numerical order by default, think you can feed or define though
len for length

Nothing really to practice

# Chap 2
'''

Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types

what is a variable, what they hold, what can you do with them,
and intro to data types for beginners.

Im going to be honest, I read this chapter, it is about basic variables so I am skipping it,
exercises include:
    printing strings, doing different things with them.
    adding ints or other math functions
    same with floats and showing that the way they are stored as bits can cause weird things.
    Otherwise nothing fancy

# Chap 1
# forgot pycharm is weird and if there is no space in front of the
# start of the words, it throws a spelling error (**cough cough** dumb **cough cough**)

Chapter 1: Python install and Hello world

installing is easy, you can go to python.org or just search on Mac (which I am on) for your python version
or install the latest version with brew python

for hello world, print is auto included so no extra libraries and can call outside a function and run it in the terminal.
