Like all computer courses, the book starts "Hello World"

Not too much to learn there but as a refresh and restart,
good to start with the basics and see if I missed anything the first time through.

I know the first time through I was 3 years in to college and was never the best student
so probably missed  something or thought I knew something or ignored some of the basics
thinking I knew better than I did.

# easy enough in python, the Print Function

# not needing any libraries or even a function,
# to print you simply say print(what you want to say

print("Hello World")

# Good to know, in python the line ender (normally a ;)
# is optional and so lines end with ; or with a new line character
